## Current state and future roadmap:
Although the program is relatively simple and easy to use, and great at what it does, it isn't perfect and there is a lot of room for improvements. I quickly hacked it together for the marketing department of the company I work at, during chunks of spare time. In future iterations of the program, i'll try and complete the following:
- [x] Release an initial version for use by the wider team
- [ ] Improve data validation of the program for quality assurance of the XML file. (For instance, display warnings and prevent XML generation if a field is empty) 
- [ ] Allow loading of existing XML file for updating
